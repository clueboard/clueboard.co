Once upon a time, Clueboard was my dream. While the business itself was focused on making keyboards, to me Clueboard meant freedom and control of my own destiny. For 6 years I lived the dream, but sadly I had to wake up.

For several years I've let this site sit vacant. If you're here because you used to support my business, welcome, it's great to see you again! Sadly, I do not have much information about my keyboards posted anymore, maybe one day I will find the time and energy to devote to that.

I am revamping it as my place to write about tech explorations. I will be writing about whatever I feel like, but my interests revolve around technology, programming, CAD, 3D Printing, CAM, and many other geeky subjects. If any of those interest you, why not add my blog to your feed reader?
