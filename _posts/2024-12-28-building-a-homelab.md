I guess I'm late to the homelab party.

A couple weeks ago I decided that I needed to build a homelab. We use Kubernetes at work, and I really don't know anything about Kubernetes. It's time for me to fix that. The best way to learn about something is to build it out and use it, so that's what I'm going to do.

I asked my team at work if anyone had a homelab situation going on, and the answer is yes, they all did. Like I said, late to the party. The setups they used ran the gamut- just spinning up AWS, proxmox on a single laptop, and one guy on my team even has a 4 node k3s cluster running on Raspberry Pi 4s.


So now I'm looking into building a homelab of my own.
